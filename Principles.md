# Community Principles

## Overview 

Transactions are only a subset of human communication and interaction. Though they define what is valuable, as well as the means or protocol by which we move and secure that value, it takes a community to invest any given transaction with meaning.

More generally, technology is always neutral. It is the network of users who define the impact that technology has on society. As such, we cannot expect to implement meaningful change at a systemic level without both sufficiently advanced technologies, and communities robust enough to use magic responsibly.

Humour goes a long way, too. Please remember that this is a living document and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) are welcome anytime with improvements and ammendments. Feel free to also just leave a comment.

I have looked at various notions of community for this initial draft, from African ones I have grown up around, to various religious traditions and practices, and more modern reimaginings like the burner community. However, I definitely haven't covered them all, so feel free to add those that are closest to your own experience.

It's no mistake that the most popular OS on web servers and other machines that leverage open source technology is called Ubuntu. Mark Shuttleworth was referencing an old and deep African concept that, on the surface, signifies our interconnectedness and interdependence. It comes from the saying *'umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu'*; a human being is a human being only through other human beings. Deeper down, though, ubuntu has to do with the structure and pattern of the universe itself, the fine balance it maintains, with humanity as the harmonising note between natural and supernatural. A little cosmic for the introducion, but we might as well start big. Ubuntu underpins all of the below, much like it probably runs the server from which you are receiving this content. Server... another interesting word.

## Principles

*1) We share, therefore we are*
> Code and ideas are open source by default, and available for anyone to download, use and abuse in a share-alike manner.

*2) We collaborate competitively*
> Our community values creative collaboration, understanding that creativity can be best served in competitive environments by the very structure of open source communities: i.e. if you don't like it, fork off. That said, we strive to produce, promote and protect the kind of language - especially at a protocol level - that enhances the development of ideas and constructive dialogue.

*3) We are open and transparent with all our peers*
> In order to use new technology responsibly, we need to understand the practical benefits it confers and how to use them most equitably. Letting go of the need for central intermediaries of trust (and therefore the possibility of systemic corruption) is not just a technological problem, it is one that requires a shift in mindset from all economic actors.

*4) Each one, teach one*
> An AfrikaBurn principle, here because phrases like 'permissionless innovation' and 'low barriers to access' are meaningless without an educated community capable of innovating in the first place. 

*5) We use technology responsibly, and to the benefit of our peers*
> Technology is neutral; its uses are not. Using technology repsonsibly doesn't necessarily mean using only one side of a double-edged blade, it means cutting with the grain of the wood.

*6) Give, without expecting anything in return*
> No, we're not asking for donations. This is just a truly beautiful concept - give of your time, give of your knowledge, give of your enthusiasm. Find something that inspires you to the point where giving is a blessing, not a burden.

*7) We do not exploit people or information*
> Because no set of principles would be complete without stating the obvious: part of forming a community is the endeavour to always speak, think, and act rightly. Oh, and don't lie, steal, kill, or worship false idols either.

*8) We participate enthusiastically*
> We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. Money is a fiction and fiction always needs a reader to participate by suspending their disbelief in order to reveal momentarily the deeper truth. We take a conscious part in the most valuable drama of our day ;)
